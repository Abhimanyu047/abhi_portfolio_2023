    I remember my very first interaction with a computer program, back in school, when we were made to write some procedures 
    (there was a thing called "logo" back in the early 2000s) or steps in order to make the "turtle" move up and down on the screen. 
    I was very overwhelmed and fascinated to see the turtle follow my instructions. As I grew up, I used to play a lot of computer games (Age of Mythology still my favorite) and had to face a lot of 
    problems while installing those games, but, that gave me an idea about how a software product is built, how powerful 
    operating systems are, why are there so many files, etc. and that developed my interest in software development and 
    programming, even more.

    During my Bachelor's degree, I learnt a lot about programming languages, Data Structures and Algorithms, 
    SQL, Natural Language Processing, Predictive Modelling, etc. In the final year, I was quite confident
    to start my career either in Software Engineering or Data Analytics. Fortunately, I got an internship
    at IBM and I completed my undergraduate degree with a distinction grade.

    I kick-started my career in Data Science at IBM and it was a wonderful journey of about three years. 
    I met some really amazing people, got to learn a lot more than I had learnt in my degree,
    worked on real-time industry problems and datasets, worked on-site with international clients like American
    Express and finally I decided to take a break from my career and pursue higher education.

    In September 2022, I came to the UK to pursue my Masters Degee in Data Science from the University of Bath.
    It was a bit intense course but a lot more in depth and full of interesting stuff! I learnt about Bayesian 
    Machine Learning, Reinforement Learning and Deep Learning which I had not learnt much about, previously. This course
    gave me a further direction in my career and I am glad I took the risk to leave my job and come all the way to 
    England. I have successfully completed my course in September 2023 and still exploring more about the topics that
    I have learnt during my course.

    I look forward to strengthen my skills as a Data Scientist, work on some challenging projects across business domains 
    and try my hands on new technologies.
